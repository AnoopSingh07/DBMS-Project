# DBMS-Project
# Advanced Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains implementations of several advanced data structures, including B+ Trees, Extendible Hashing, and Multi-Bucket Linked Lists. The implementations are written in C++ and include both source code and executables.

## Project Structure



### B+ Tree

- **AcceptedB+tree2Level.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of a two-level B+ Tree, including operations like insertion and deletion.
- **AcceptedB+treeMultiLevel.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of a multi-level B+ Tree to handle more complex scenarios.

### Extended Hashing

- **AcceptedExtendibleHashing.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of extendible hashing, a dynamic hashing technique that adjusts the hash table size as needed.
- **AcceptedPartialHashing.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of partial hashing for comparison with extendible hashing.

### Multi-Bucket Linked List

- **AcceptedDoubleBucketLlinkedList.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of a multi-bucket linked list that supports two buckets per node.
- **AcceptedSingleBucketLinkedList.cpp / .exe**: Implementation of a simpler single-bucket linked list.

## How to Run

Each directory contains both source files (.cpp) and executable files (.exe). To run the executables, simply navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the `.exe` file.

### Example:

```bash
cd B+Tree
./AcceptedB+tree2Level.exe
